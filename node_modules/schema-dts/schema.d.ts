 * We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and"url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well knownURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".
 *
 * For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a {@link http://schema.org/WebContent WebContent} type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "{@link http://schema.org/text text}" summary of the page. It isunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.
 *
 * We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, {@link http://schema.org/openingHours openingHours}, {@link http://schema.org/Event Event}, {@link http://schema.org/FAQPage FAQPage} etc. By linking to those pages from a {@link http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement SpecialAnnouncement} you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the {@link http://schema.org/category category} property of the {@link http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement SpecialAnnouncement}.
 *
 * Many {@link http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement SpecialAnnouncement}s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use {@link http://schema.org/spatialCoverage spatialCoverage} for the region, and {@link http://schema.org/announcementLocation announcementLocation} to indicate specific {@link http://schema.org/LocalBusiness LocalBusiness}es and {@link http://schema.org/CivicStructures CivicStructures}. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both {@link http://schema.org/spatialCoverage spatialCoverage} and {@link http://schema.org/announcementLocation announcementLocation}.
 *
 * The {@link http://schema.org/about about} property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using {@link http://schema.org/about about} onlyfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a {@link http://schema.org/Course Course} or a {@link http://schema.org/RadioStation RadioStation}). For places, use {@link http://schema.org/announcementLocation announcementLocation} and {@link http://schema.org/spatialCoverage spatialCoverage}. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.
 *
 * The basic content of {@link http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement SpecialAnnouncement} is similar to that of an {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS RSS} or {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard) Atom} feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting{@link http://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement SpecialAnnouncement} updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feedwith the {@link http://schema.org/webFeed webFeed} property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline {@link http://schema.org/DataFeed DataFeed} object, with {@link http://schema.org/encodingFormat encodingFormat} providingmedia type information e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".
